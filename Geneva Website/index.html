        Geneva is also home to a unique restaurant called <a href="http://www.intensus.ch/3/"><i> Intensus</i></a>, where you pay more for the experience than for the food (However, the food is still very good.) You are seated in a restaurant with only one table and 9 chairs, and eat what is served to you instead of ordering. It is said that the owner holds great <i>passion</i> for cooking, which is why it is famous among locals.
